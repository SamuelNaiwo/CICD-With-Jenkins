## Difference between CD & CDE?

- Continuous delivery automates deployment of a release to a staging or testing environment, while continuous deployment automatically deploys every release to production.

What Continuous Delivery (CD) Does and Doesn't Do.
- CD automatically deploys releases to a testing or staging environment.
- CD does not automatically deploy code changes to production.
- CD does require human intervention to deploy a release from staging to production.

What Continuous Deployment (CDE) Does and Doesn't Do.
- CDE automatically deploys releases from building through testing and into production.
- CDE doesn't require human intervention.
- CDE doesn't ensure your testing culture and protocol is up to snuff. It simply looks for a checked box and, if it finds the box is checked, deploys the release to production and beyond.
